FREEMODE Data Journey
Hi, I'm Kenny — a future data analyst, coffee lover, and digital traveler.
This repository records my progress in data-related skills, from Python to SQL to data visualization.

## Folders

- `python-learning/` — Python programming fundamentals (via Harvard's CS50P)
- `pandas-practice/` — Hands-on data cleaning and processing
- `sql-exercises/` — LeetCode & project-based SQL
- `web-scraping/` — Simple scrapers using requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium
- `visualization/` — Data visualized with Python or Power BI
- `freemode-projects/` — Real-world projects during my FREEMODE journey (e.g., Chiang Mai data-for-accommodation tasks)

## About Me

Ex-military. Self-taught. FREEMODE believer.  
I learn step by step, build project by project, and live on my own terms.
